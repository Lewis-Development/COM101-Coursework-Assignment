## Submission Deadline: before noon on Monday 7th December 2020 (Week 12)
This Assignment contributes 100% of the overall module mark. It requires you to use Python’s Standard Library Functions to develop a Book Store Inventory Program and provide a walkthrough demonstration of your program and underpinning code base via a recorded vodcast. 

**Task 1:** You should attempt to develop the following functionality using Python:
* Read in data from a text file containing details of book title held in stock and store these into a List data structure.
* The user should remain within the program until they select a menu option ‘8’ to quit.
* Implement a set of menu options: 

>BASIC FEATURES
>1.	Output a list of books titles and their respective details, including a summary report displaying (a) total number of book titles and (b) total value of books in stock.
>2.	Output average price of books in stock [note: only title with stock levels > 0 should be included in the calculation].
>3.	Output a report detailing the number of books existing in each genre type.

>ADVANCED FEATURES
>1.	Option to add new book item and present a summary report displaying (a) the increase in total number of titles in stock and (b) the cost difference in average price of books in stock.
>2.	Query if a book title is available and present option of (a) increasing stock level or (b) decreasing the stock level, due to a sale. If the stock level is decreased to zero indicate to the user that the book is currently out of stock. 
>3.	Query the List to return book items ordered in alphabetic order by title or genre.
>4.	Plot a labelled bar chart that presents the number of books existing in each genre type.

*A sample text file containing a list of book titles and is available for download from Blackboard Learn (BBL).*

**Task 2:** You are required to produce a vodcast, lasting no more than 4 minutes, which provides a walkthrough demonstration of your program accompanied by a review of the code base. __The vodcast is a mandatory part of the assignment and is the primary element from which the main learning outcomes will be assessed.__ A detailed guide, outlining what the vodcast needs to contain, is provide at the end of this specification. __Vodcasts that go beyond 4 minutes will be penalised.__
